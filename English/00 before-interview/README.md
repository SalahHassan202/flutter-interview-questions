# 🧠 Before the Interview

This section is made especially to help you feel calm before any Flutter interview.  
Whether it’s your first interview, you’ve been through interviews before and feel unsure, or you’re prepared but still nervous.

Read it slowly, my friend. Don’t be too hard on yourself.  
Goodness is coming, God willing 🤍

# 🤍 Before anything else… focus on this

> **﴿And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised﴾**  
> _Surah Adh-Dhariyat (22)_

Believe me, your provision is not in my hands, not in your hands, and not in the hands of any human being.  
Your provision is in Allah’s hands.

We all strive, we all try, and we all do our best — but don’t panic.  
Do what you can, leave the rest to Allah, and trust that He will take care of you, me, and everyone else 🤍

## **🤔 How do Flutter interviews usually work?**

In most companies, the interview is not just one round.  
It usually goes through multiple stages:

- **HR Interview**  
  A friendly conversation about you, your background, and how you think.

- **Technical Interview**  
  Questions about Dart, Flutter, logic, and problem-solving.

- **Live Coding (not always)**  
  You might be asked to write some code or solve a small problem.

- **System Design (usually for mid & senior levels)**  
  They care about how you think, not how much you memorize.

Not every company follows the same process.  
Each company is different — so don’t overthink it.

---

## **🧩 Types of interviews you might face**

- Online (Zoom / Google Meet / Teams)
- Onsite (at the company)
- Assignment or task before the interview
- A short interview (30 minutes)

Don’t worry — it’s usually simpler than you imagine.

---

## **✅ What should you do before the interview?**

- Review the fundamentals (you don’t need to review everything).
- Understand what you studied — don’t just memorize.
- Get enough sleep the night before.
- Read a bit about the company (even a few lines help).
- If possible, ask someone who works there about the company.
- Prepare a short self-introduction (both Arabic and English).
- Be ready to talk about what you’ve worked on, even small projects.

You’re not expected to be a genius — you’re expected to understand.

---

## **❌ What should you NOT do before the interview?**

- Don’t try to study everything in the last hour.
- Don’t go in tired or exhausted.
- Don’t lie about anything.
- Don’t say “I don’t know” and stay silent — explain how you would try to find the answer.
- Don’t compare yourself to others.

If you don’t know something, say it honestly — and think out loud.  
That leaves a very good impression.

---

## **🎒 What should you bring? What should you avoid?**

### If the interview is online:
- Stable internet connection
- A quiet place
- A fully charged laptop
- Decent clothes (look presentable)
- Your ID
- Pen and paper

### If the interview is onsite:
- Printed CV
- Your laptop
- Be ready to show your projects if asked
- Phone on silent
- Confidence in yourself

❌ Avoid bringing:
- Extra stress
- Fear
- The feeling that you’re less than others

---

## **🗣️ How should you answer questions?**

- Listen to the full question.
- Take a second to think.
- Answer calmly.
- If you forget something, try to reason it out loud.
- The interview is a discussion, not an exam.

Thinking out loud is a strength — not a weakness.

---

## **😬 Common mistakes many candidates make**

- Sounding like they memorized answers without understanding.
- Getting nervous from the very first question.
- Undervaluing themselves.
- Staying silent when they don’t know.
- Going into unnecessary details.

Be simple, clear, calm — and answer only what’s asked.

---

## **👨‍💼 Common HR questions (don’t be afraid of them)**

### **Tell us about yourself**
Talk about your work, not your entire life story.

### **Why Flutter?**
Talk about your real experience, not memorized answers.

### **What is your weakness?**
Mention a real weakness — and how you’re working on improving it.

### **Have you worked in a team before?**
University projects, freelancing, or personal projects — all count.

## **💡 If you feel you’re not ready**

Listen carefully, my friend 🤍  
No one ever enters an interview 100% ready.

Every interview gives you:
- Experience
- A lesson
- One step forward

Even if you don’t get accepted — you still win.  
You gain confidence, remove fear, and understand what to improve.

If you get accepted — great, you got the job.  
If not — it’s still good. You gained courage and experience.

---

## **💪 If you feel ready**

It’s still normal to feel nervous.  
Just remember:
- You worked hard
- You studied
- You practiced
- You tried

## ⭐ Real Interview Tips (from real experience)

- The first question is usually easy — it’s meant to break the ice.
- If you get a difficult question, don’t assume you failed.
- Thinking out loud is powerful — interviews are not silent exams.
- If you forget something, try to connect it to something similar.
- Sometimes being calm and clear matters more than a perfect answer.
- Saying “I don’t know” and explaining how you would approach it is better than guessing.
- Interviewers respect honesty more than overconfidence.
- Even if the interview doesn’t feel perfect, stay positive until the end.
- Many people got accepted even after making mistakes.
- An interview is an experience — not a final judgment on your worth.
